# BarleyEnvironmentGWS

## Description

This repository contains information and code for replicating the analyses performed in the article below:

Article Title: *Accurate genomewide predictions of barley phenotypes across North American environments*  
Journal: *Science* (under review)  
Authors: Jeffrey L. Neyhart, Kevin A.T. Silverstein, and Kevin P. Smith

## Navigation

### Data

Data used in this study are available from the [Triticeae Toolbox](https://triticeaetoolbox.org/barley). See [this README](`r file.path(gsub(pattern = "\\.git", replacement = "", x = git2r::remote_url()), "tree/master/Data")`) for instructions on accessing this data.

### Code

Scripts used to complete the analysis and generate figures outlined in the article above are available in the "Scripts" subfolder. See [this README](`r file.path(gsub(pattern = "\\.git", replacement = "", x = git2r::remote_url()), "tree/master/Scripts")`) for information on the scripts and their intended execution order.

Three scripts in this directory are used by all other scripts:

1. `source.R` - loads packages, creates directory links, and loads data.
2. `source_MSI.R` - runs script #1 with modifications for high-performance computing supported by the [Minnesota Supercomputing Institute](https://www.msi.umn.edu/).
3. `source_functions.R` - loads additional functions into the environment. 


## Software/package versions

*R* version `r paste0(version$major, ".", version$minor)` was used to complete analyses in this project.


The following packages (with version information) were used to complete this project:


```{r version, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# Scan the source function and all scripts for packages
packages <- list.files(path = getwd(), full.names = TRUE, pattern = ".R$", recursive = TRUE) %>% 
  str_subset(string = ., pattern = "archive", negate = TRUE) %>%
  map(readLines) %>% 
  map(~str_subset(., "library\\(|require\\(")) %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  str_subset(., "#", negate = TRUE) %>%
  str_trim() %>%
  str_extract("\\(.*\\)") %>% 
  str_remove_all("\\(|\\)") %>% 
  unique()

# get descriptions of each package; create a tibble
package_info <- installed.packages() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  filter(Package %in% packages) %>% 
  select(package = Package, version = Version) %>%
  arrange(package)

# Output a table
knitr::kable(package_info)


```
